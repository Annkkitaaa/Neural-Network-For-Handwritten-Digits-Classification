# Neural-Network-For-Handwritten-Digits-Classification
This repository contains code for training and using a neural network to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Overview
The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), along with their corresponding labels. The goal of this project is to train a neural network model to accurately classify these digits.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
TensorFlow
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)
